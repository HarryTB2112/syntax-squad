Project Title: BrainVille

Project Description:

A website with 4 games; "Hangman: Countries and Capitals", 
"Hangman: Italian nouns", "Guess who: English Kings" and 
"Translating race: Italian nouns". 
Currently, only "Hangman: Countries and Capitals" has been implemented. 
The game is hidden underneath the main page which can be entered by clicking the top left red squircle.


The point of these games is to increase interest in Non-STEM subjects in secondary schools. 
This project was requested by the management team of the Hive group of secondary schools.
